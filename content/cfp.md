**LSC'26 is the 9th edition of the Lifelog Search Challenge**, a full-day workshop held in conjunction with the ACM ICMR 2026 conference, taking place in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in June 2026.

LSC is a highly interactive forum dedicated to the design, development, and evaluation of interactive lifelog retrieval systems. The workshop combines peer-reviewed research presentations with a moderated live search competition, creating a rare space where ideas are tested under real-time constraints.

## Workshop Tracks and Submissions

We invite submissions to one of three distinct tracks:

### 1. General Lifelog Research Track

This track welcomes high-quality research contributions addressing the broader lifelogging ecosystem. Submissions may explore methodological, technical, or human-centred perspectives, including but not limited to:

* **Data Analysis & Management**: Indexing, retrieval algorithms, and multimodal data fusion.
* **User Experience**: Novel visualization techniques, interactive interfaces, and summarization.
* **Applications**: Health and well-being monitoring, memory assistance, and digital preservation.
* **Ethics & Privacy**: Privacy-preserving technologies, data governance, and ethical frameworks.
* **Infrastructures**: Dataset creation, benchmarking methodologies, and lifelogging sensors/wearables.

### 2. Search System Track (Participation Track)

This track centres on the live interactive competition, a defining feature of LSC. Submissions to this track must both describe a system and participate in the synchronous challenge.

Participants compete to identify relevant items from a large-scale multimodal lifelog archive (~100GB) by solving live, multimedia information needs issued during the workshop. The goal is simple but demanding: retrieve the correct items as quickly and accurately as possible and submit them to the LSC server.

Any exploratory multimodal search system is eligible, including tools that support:

* Interactive retrieval and filtering
* Browsing, navigation, and visual exploration
* Automatic or AI-driven content analysis

> **Note**: There are no restrictions on system functionality, with the sole exception that presentation screen recording during the competition is not permitted.

Submissions must provide a clear and detailed description of the system, with particular emphasis on how it supports interactive lifelog search under time pressure.

### 3. Open Source Track

The Open Source Track aims to lower the entry barrier, strengthen reproducibility, and accelerate community progress.

This track invites papers describing fully functional interactive search systems from previous LSC competitions that have been released as ready-to-use open source software. The emphasis is on practical reuse rather than novelty alone.

Submissions must:

* Describe the system architecture and core design decisions.
* Provide clear documentation and setup instructions.
* Include a publicly accessible open-source repository.

The expectation is that new teams could realistically install, run, and extend the system when preparing for future LSC challenges.

## Submission Guidelines

* **Length**: Up to 6 ACM pages, with one additional page permitted for references.
* **Review Process**: All submissions will undergo a single-blind peer review process.
* **Publication**: Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the ICMR conference.
* **Presentation**: Accepted papers should be presented in an oral session and as a poster during the LSC'26 workshop.
