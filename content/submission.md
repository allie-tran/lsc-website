# Submission Guidelines

In order to participate, a team must submit a paper describing their system or research. The paper submission must adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Formatting:** All papers must be formatted according to the **ACM proceedings style**.
* **Length:** Should not exceed 6 pages.
* **Submission Format:** PDF (max file size 20MB).
* **Language:** Written in English.
* **Review Process:** LSC’26 will use a **single-blind review** process for paper and system selection.
* **Publication:** All accepted LSC’26 papers will be published in the **ACM Digital Library** in the LSC workshop series.
* **Journal Opportunity:** Authors will be given an opportunity to prepare an enhanced, substantially modified version for a special issue of a relevant journal in late 2026.

Since LSC'26 features multiple submission tracks, please follow the specific guidelines for your chosen track:

* **Search System Track:** Focus on describing the system and its operation. It is advisable to provide initial results based on the test and validation topics released with the dataset. A long description of the dataset is not necessary, as organisers provide this separately.
* **Other Tracks:** Please follow the specific guidelines provided on the [Call for Papers](https://www.google.com/search?q=../cfp) page.
