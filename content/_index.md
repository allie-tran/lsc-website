The **9th annual Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC'26)** will take place during the **ACM ICMR'26** conference in **Amsterdam, The Netherlands** in June 2026. The LSC is a participation workshop where teams compete to develop leading-edge retrieval tools for personal lifelog data. As with all previous versions, LSC'26 is a highly interactive and entertaining event where participants write and present research papers and evaluate their search engines in a real-time competition.

# 🚀 What's new for 2026?

This year introduces significant expansions to the workshop's traditional format to foster deeper research and community collaboration:

* **Expanded Submission Tracks:** Beyond the traditional competition papers, we have added a **General Lifelog Research Track** for broader lifelogging studies and an **Open Source Track** to encourage the sharing of retrieval systems. See the [Call for Papers](./CFP) for more details.
* **Brand New Dataset:** The challenge will transition to a new dataset featuring four years of rich multimodal lifelog data, including wearable camera images, biometrics, activities, and locations.

# Workshop Format

The full-day workshop is divided into two primary parts:

1. **Morning Session**: Dedicated to oral presentations of all accepted papers from the three submission tracks.
2. **Afternoon Session**: The comparative search engine challenge, where participating teams compete in real-time to solve 24 evaluation topics.

Participants in the **Search System Track** must bring a prototype interactive lifelog search engine developed for the LSC'26 dataset. The competition is held in a physical configuration where teams submit found items to a central server that tracks speed and accuracy on a live scoreboard.
